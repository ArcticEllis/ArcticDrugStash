# ARCTICELLIS ArcticDrugStash 

Description: 
4 Unique areas that have hidden / partially hidden areas which you can implement your own code for people to pick up and distribute illegal drugs from. I will try to add more locations which you can add in and remove if discovered on would like more locations.

## Installation

I try to make all my work easily installable to your servers so you should simply be able to:

> Drag and drop the ArcticDrugStash into your resources
> Add ArcticDrugStash to your server.cfg or extenal.cfg file

## Locations

> 1 - LS Docks hidden under a red container.
> 2 - Vinewood hidden under a blue tent.
> 3 - Great Chaparal near the church on route 68.
> 4 - Grapeseed next to the highway in a container.
